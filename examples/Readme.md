# Arduino Examples

There are no examples that are directly supported by the Arduino IDE. This is because of Arduino's complex and convoluted dependency and compilation design. However, you can find examples in the [examples folder](../extras/PIO-Examples/) that are compatible with the PlatformIO IDE.
