# CSE_Touch

**CSE_Touch** is an Arduino library from [*CIRCUITSTATE Electronics*](https://www.circuitstate.com/). It is a unified touch interface library for the Arduino platform. The advantage of using a unified library is that you can change the touch panel in your application code very easily with only minor changes to the code. CSE_Touch is desigend to be extensible and compatible with our CSE_UI library.Currently, the library supports the following touch controllers.

- FT6206
- CST328

## Installation

This library is available from the official **Arduino Library Manager**. Open the Arduino IDE, search for "CSE_Touch" and install the latest version of the library.

Additionally, you can download the latest release package from the GitHub repository and install it manually. To do so, open the Arduino IDE, go to `Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Libraryâ€¦` and select the downloaded file.

Another method is to clone the GitHub repository directly into your `libraries` folder. The development branch will have the latest features, bug fixes and other changes. To do so, navigate to your `libraries` folder (usually located at `Documents/Arduino/libraries` on Windows and `~/Documents/Arduino/libraries` on macOS) and execute the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/CIRCUITSTATE/CSE_Touch.git
```

[**Git**](https://git-scm.com) should be installed on your computer.

The library can also be installed via [**PlatformIO**](https://platformio.org). All officially listed Arduino listed libraries are automatically fetched by PlatformIO. Use the [`lib_deps`](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/projectconf/sections/env/options/library/lib_deps.html) search option to install the library.

## Dependencies

Based on the touch controller you want to use, the driver is automatically selected by the CSE_Touch library. Currently, the following libraries from CIRCUTISTATE are supported. Make sure to install them depending on which one you are going to use.

- [CSE_CST328](https://github.com/CIRCUITSTATE/CSE_CST328) - For CST328 capacitive touch controllers.
- [CSE_FT6206](https://github.com/CIRCUITSTATE/CSE_FT6206) - For FT6206 capacitive touch controllers.

## Example

The following example shows how to read the PM values from the sensor and print them. You can find more examples in the [examples folder](/examples/).

```cpp
#include <Arduino.h>
#include <CSE_Touch.h>

// Define the serial port pins here.
#define  PIN_SERIAL_TX1  16
#define  PIN_SERIAL_RX1  17

CSE_Touch pmSensor (Serial1);  // Create a CSE_Touch object to access the sensor

// Setup runs once.
void setup() {
  Serial.begin (115200);  // Initialize the debug serial port
  Serial1.begin (9600, SERIAL_8N1, PIN_SERIAL_RX1, PIN_SERIAL_TX1); // Initialize the sensor serial port

  pmSensor.begin(); // Initialize the sensor
}

// Inifinite loop.
void loop() {
  if (pmSensor.getPmData()) {
    Serial.println ("Data received. Printing data..");
    Serial.print ("PM1.0: ");
    Serial.print (pmSensor.pm1);
    Serial.println (" ug/m3");

    Serial.print ("PM2.5: ");
    Serial.print (pmSensor.pm25);
    Serial.println (" ug/m3");

    Serial.print ("PM10: ");
    Serial.print (pmSensor.pm10);
    Serial.println (" ug/m3");
    Serial.println();
  }
  
  else {
    Serial.println ("Data not received. Retrying..");
  }

  delay (1000);
}
```
