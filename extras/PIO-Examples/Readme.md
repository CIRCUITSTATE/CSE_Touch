# PlatformIO Examples

Here you can find examples for the CSE_Touch library. Simply open the `PIO-Examples` folder in VS Code and you will be able to compile all of the examples easily. The PlatformIO extension should be already installed and configured. When you open any folder in VS Code with the `platformio.ini` file in the root folder, the PIO extension is automatically invoked and you will be able to compile and upload. Check the screenshot below for a reference.

To choose which folder to compile and upload, click on the `env:` tab on the bottom bar and then choose the example you want. Use the tick icon to compile and the right arrow icon to upload.
